# this is to evaluate the end time of a period of time, given as a number of minutes (it could be arbitrarily large). The start time is given as a pair of hours (0..23) and minutes (0..59). The result has to be printed to the console.
# using modulo % 

hour = int(input("Starting time (hours): ")) 
mins = int(input("Starting time (minutes): "))
dura = int(input("Event duration (minutes): "))


# convert hours to minutes and sum all minutes (total minutes)
time_to_minutes = hour * 60 + mins + dura


# check how many minutes left from dividing total minutes by 60 (1 hour)
new_minutes = time_to_minutes % 60


# subtract above modulo from total minutes to get 'full' hours
# using modulo % 24 to check if 24 hours passed since user input hour
new_hour = int(((time_to_minutes - new_minutes) / 60) % 24 )


# print the result in HH:MM string
print(str(new_hour) + ":" + str(new_minutes))


# Sample input:
# 12
# 17
# 59

# Expected output: 13:16


# Sample input:
